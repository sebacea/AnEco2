# Pendientes 

-   We follow Zame (Ecma 2007), a general equilibrium model of firm
    formation

-   We use a particular case of this configuration with endogenous
    anonymous interactions that consider explicitly incentives to trust
    or betray

    -   there are two perfectly divisible commodities traded on
        competitive markets

    -   many identical agents (in terms of preferences and endowments of
        the two commodities) and

    -   a representative two-person generalized trust-interaction among
        individuals.
